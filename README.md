# FiveNightsWithMrVeliz

## Currently remaking [Five Nights With Mr. Veliz](https://github.com/Noohal/FiveNightswithMrVeliz-UNITY-) in Godot.

A parody clone of the game "Five Nights at Freddy's" I am making as a joke based on my friend.

## Game Premise
You are a security guard working at Saks High. Mr. Veliz is staying the night to grade assignments and he is getting angry because of the unending pile of lab reports. He has anger issues and needs to take it out on someone. Your goal is to survive until the end of the week.
